# chessfluff

Application that pulls various stats for a user from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com) using the public API.

Created for my own use, you may be able to use it for reference to understand how to work with the chess.com API.

## Set up
### Create settings file
You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following information:

```sh
uaemail=YOUR_EMAIL
uausername=YOUR_USERNAME

lookupuser=USER_TO_LOOKUP
```
